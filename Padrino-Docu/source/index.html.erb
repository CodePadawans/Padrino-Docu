  Padrino is a ruby framework built upon the Sinatra web library. Sinatra is a DSL for creating simple web applications in Ruby. Padrino was created to make it fun and easy to code more advanced web applications while still adhering to the spirit that makes Sinatra great!

  <h3>Sinatra Core</h3>

  Many people love the simplicity and expressiveness of Sinatra but quickly find themselves missing a great deal of functionality provided by other web frameworks such as Rails when building non-trivial applications.

  Sinatra acts as a thin layer on top of Rack itself and the “micro”-framework is kept light introducing complexities only when required by the particular application. Our goal with Padrino is to stay true to the core principles of Sinatra including a focus on simplicity and modularity.

  Starting from this assumption, we have developed a different approach to a web development framework. We expand on Sinatra through the addition of standard libraries including helpers, components, and other functionality that are needed in a framework suitable for arbitrarily complex web applications.
